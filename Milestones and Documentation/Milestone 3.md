#### Software used for UML Diagram: IBM Rational Rose

# Glossary 

### The Domain model was made using the IBM Rational Rose software. The Model Has following Classes in the Class Diagram. 

### User (Actor): 

Here we have two kinds of Users. One is who will post a job and another one is who will pick a job. The job poster can post jobs and from them, the job seeker can select the job. One user can post one to many jobs and similarly the user can select one to many jobs. Any of the user must have to login before searching or posting a job. If they are not registered before, they need to fill the registration page and there they must give necessary information like name, email, phone number etc.

### Pick: 
In this class, it will have the pick_job( ) function, “pick a job” feature will be using this class. It will also hold some attributes of that specific jobs and that user. This class can have one to many users. And one to many jobs.

### Post: 
In this class, it will have the postJob( ) function, “post a job” feature will be using this class. It will also hold some attributes of that specific jobs and that user. Each post will have one and only one user who posts.This class can have only one job.

### Assign: 
This class will only assign jobs using the function assignJob( ). This class has one and only one user. But can have one to many jobs. 

### Job: 
This class will have all the specifications for the jobs. It also has the option to modify jobs. The jobs have valid date, job categories, job priority, job status and others. Job status must be done from both sides before making any payments. Jobs with high priority will be shown in the top of the home page. The job category will help the users to find the jobs according to their interests.

### Payment: 
The whole payment part is done over here. This class will have all the necessary information from the assign class and the user class. This has the function of chargebill( ), paytopicker( ) and Job_status_confirmation( ). The payment is made with aggregation, which means the user must pay once the job status confirmation is yes from both the sides of the job poster and the job worker(user).

4)	Proof of knowledge for the skills they list for any technical/professional jobs from job seeker
5)	Make sure all the job seekers are above the age of 17 year (minimum age to work in Canada)
6)	Create a script to add a new user(Job seeker or job poster) to the database
7)	Create a script to add a new job to the database and they displaying it 
8)	As a job poster I want to edit the job I posted

After the job seeker completes the job upto the requirements  of the job, after confirming this with the job poster we transfer the money to the person who completed the job. This way we can make sure no one can be a fraud. 
21)	Both the job seeker and the job poster should have a feedback option for each other
22)	Write test plan for the project
