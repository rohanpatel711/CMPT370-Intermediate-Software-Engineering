# Epics Annotated:

1) I would like to know the approximate time it would take to complete a job so that I know how much am I getting paid and is it reasonable according to the hours I am working.
2) I would like to learn more about the company and its history.
3) Knowing information about the company’s history can be found in the information component.
4) I want a service that is quick and easy to understand without prior knowledge.
5) I want to be able to keep a track of my previous jobs and the employers should be able to see it as my experience.
6) I want to see more reasonable job postings considering my convenience, free time and comfort.
7) I want the application to be user-accessible and friendly so that many people use it. This should be considered during the creation of the GUI.
8) I want to be able to search job listings by keywords, location, skill description and salary so I can focus my job search
9) As a job poster, I want to edit the job I posted for any updates in time or requirement or money
