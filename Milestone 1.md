# Milestone 1 - Product Vision

# Product name : Rock A Job
## Product Description
Our product is designed to help users who want to make quick money by doing an odd job or for users who are not skilled enough to do that job can get it done by posting it. Odd jobs are not just limited to trimming lawns or shoveling snow but can vary vastly from designing and building a small webpage to walking a dog.  
A job post will have the job description along with the straight pay associated with it. The user posting the job will also have an option to make the post accept offers, which they can later browse to pick an offer.  

## Need and Value
We believe that our product will fit perfectly in the community as there are job posting sites where you can go find full/part-time or contract jobs, or there are products like Kijiji or craigslist which is not designed to be job search sites. If designed correctly with an easy and user-friendly interface, we believe that our idea can be of great significance.  
There are already some odd job posting and picking apps/webpages out there but all of them have some things in common which are holding them from picking up. They all have a complicated user-interface, are not visually appealing, and are not secure. We have plans to overcome these problems.  

## Stakeholders
The initial stakeholders for the project are the group members. Friends and family who are expected to test the product alongside production can be potential stakeholders.

## Quality Assurance
Fortunately, there are a couple of apps available on app stores that are quite similar to our project. Aside from using those apps ourselves, we have studied through their review sections and noted the problems their users posted. The main problems users encounter while using this kind of product are security, complications and user-unfriendly interface. We will take steps to address and solve these problems.

## Technology requirements
So far we have decided to make a website, which will require HTML/CSS and Javascript. Storing all the user information will require a possible SQL database. We are still deciding whether to use or not any kind of web framework(Bootstrap, Ruby JS, Django). We will also require a staging environment to host/deploy the website. 
  
## Action Plan
We planned, designed and made the initial looks for the home and login pages.  
Shubh and Rohan designed the Home page.   
Alavi and Saiduzzaman designed the Login page.  
We will pick a design and work the project around it.
